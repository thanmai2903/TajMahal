      You Deserve to Visit - The Taj! Once More!
    </h1>
    <div>
      Shah Jahan commissioned the Taj Mahal in 1632, shortly after the death of
      his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The construction took approximately 22 years, with
      the mausoleum itself being completed in 1643, and the surrounding
      structures and gardens finished in 1653. Over 20,000 artisans and
      craftsmen worked on the project, with materials sourced from across India
      and Asia. The Taj Mahal was built as a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal, but it also
      served as a symbol of Shah Jahan's deep love for her. Mumtaz Mahal, whose
      real name was Arjumand Banu Begum, was the emperor's third wife and bore
      him 14 children. She was his favorite, and her death left Shah Jahan
      heartbroken. After the completion of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan intended to
      build a black marble mausoleum for himself across the Yamuna River.
      However, before he could realize this vision, he was deposed by his son
      Aurangzeb and spent the rest of his life under house arrest in Agra Fort.
      Upon his death, Shah Jahan was buried next to Mumtaz Mahal in the Taj
      Mahal.

    <h1 style="text-align: center">Architecture of the Taj Mahal</h1>
    <div>
      The Taj Mahal is a masterpiece of symmetry. The central dome, which is the
      most prominent feature of the structure, is 73 meters (240 feet) tall.
      Flanked by four smaller domes and four minarets, the entire structure is
      perfectly balanced and aligned. The minarets are slightly tilted outward,
      a deliberate design choice to prevent them from collapsing on the main
      structure in case of an earthquake. The Taj Mahal is made primarily of
      white marble from Makrana, Rajasthan. The marble is inlaid with precious
      and semi-precious stones like jade, crystal, lapis lazuli, amethyst, and
      turquoise, forming intricate floral patterns. The inlay work is known as
      "pietra dura," a technique brought to India by the Mughals. Inside the
      mausoleum, the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan are enclosed by a
      finely carved marble screen, or jali. The actual graves are in a lower
      chamber, directly beneath the cenotaphs. The walls and ceilings of the
      interior are adorned with calligraphy from the Quran, intricate carvings,
      and decorative elements. The Taj Mahal is set in a vast Mughal garden,
      which is laid out in a symmetrical pattern with pathways, fountains, and
      reflecting pools.

        The marble of the Taj Mahal appears to change color depending on the
        time of day and the quality of light. It appears pinkish in the morning,
        milky white during the day, and golden at night under the moonlight. The
        calligraphy on the walls of the Taj Mahal includes verses from the
        Quran. The script appears uniform, but the letters are larger as they go
        higher, an optical illusion that makes the text appear consistent from
        top to bottom. The construction of the Taj Mahal is estimated to have
        cost about 32 million Indian rupees at the time, which would be
        equivalent to billions of dollars today. Materials were sourced from all
        over India and Asia, and it is said that a thousand elephants were used
        to transport building materials. Over the centuries, the Taj Mahal has
        faced various threats, including pollution, which has caused the marble
        to yellow. Conservation efforts have included regular cleaning and the
        application of a clay pack treatment known as "multani mitti" to restore
        the marbleâ€™s whiteness. There are many legends associated with the Taj
        Mahal. One popular but unproven legend suggests that Shah Jahan had the
        hands of the craftsmen and architects severed after the construction so
        that they could never replicate such a masterpiece. The Taj Mahal
        remains a symbol of India's rich history, artistic achievement, and the
        enduring power of love. Its beauty continues to inspire visitors from
        around the world.
